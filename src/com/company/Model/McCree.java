                "your line of sight, you won't hit them. That being said, even if you can see them, but they are behind a shield, you will shoot the\n" +

                "----------------------\n" +
                "Tip Number 2: You ult pairs very well with a Reinhardt Earhshatter because whoever he stuns, you can pick off because they have no protection.\n" +
                "----------------------\n" +
                "Tip 3: Your flashbang is a fantastic ability. You can throw it above a Rein shield to stun him out of shield to get free damage on him or his teammates.\n" +
                "--------------------\n" +
                "Tip 4: You combat roll reloads your gun after you roll. Try Fan The Hammer on a tank, rolling to reload quick, and Fan The Hammer again on the same\n" +
