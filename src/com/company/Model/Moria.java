                "Tip 2: Moria's Biotic Orbs bounce off of surfaces, use this to your advantage. You can throw it at all wall and have it bounce to your teammates to heal them if you\n" +
                "don't have a cleat line of sight, or use her damage orb to hit enemies around walls or behind barriers to charge up her ult.\n" +
                "-------------------------\n" +
                "Tip 3: Moria's ultimate is not a damage ultimate. Yes, you can use it to finish off a low health team, but it is a healing ultimate so use it as such.\n" +
