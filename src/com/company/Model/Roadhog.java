                "Tip 1: You can use Roadhog's Hook to do basically anything. If any enemy is about to ult or in mid ult, you can hook them in and their ult won't go off, you can hook\n" +
                "enemies over the edge of the map, and you can use you hook to pull a target to you to get either a free kill or a lot of damage on your target. However,\n" +
                "his hook can not go through shields, will stop pulling in your enemy if they get behind a wall when you hook makes contact, or if they are already behind a wall.\n" +
                "----------------------\n" +
                "Tip 2: Roadhog's Ult is great for knocking people off of the map, off of objective, or pinning an enemy to a wall and just getting an easy kill.\n" +
                "-----------------------\n" +
                "Tip 3: Roadhog can tank by himself if you know how to play him. He is best when paired with Orisa for a Halt-Hook combo to get a free kill on an enemy\n" +
                "but he also pairs great with a Reinhardt or Sigma.\n");
