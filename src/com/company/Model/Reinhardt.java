                "team either retreat to safety or take the objective by force.\n" +
                "Tip 3: While using Reinhardts' Charge ability, don't charge into deep. The enemy has a free kill. Try to pick off either \n" +
                "an enemy tank or healer to get the most of your charge and if the enemy gets to close, use it to give your team some space, \n" +
