                "--------------------\n" +
                "Tip 2: Ana's ult is very effective when paired with Genji's Dragonblade (called Nano-Blade) or Rein in general (called Nano-Rein) and it can be used \n" +
                "to alt a team fight completely. Be careful though because if you go to use your ult on a target, but your teammate walks infront of it, they will get \n" +
