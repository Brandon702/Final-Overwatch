                "to get your ultimate out faster and save your team.\n" +
                "---------------------------\n" +
                "Tip 2: Every hero has a map they are best on, and some heroes can be played on any map. That being said, \n" +
                "if you are playing Support and you get the map Ilios, use Lucio because he can boop people off the map for kills.\n" +
                "----------------------\n" +
                "Tip 3: Always be wall riding. Lucio is the only character who can wall ride and you are harder to track\n" +
                "and hit while you are doing so and you move faster. It allows you to get back to your team faster, contest points\n" +
                "better than most heroes, and makes the game a little more fun riding around the map walls like you own the place.\n" +
                "----------------------\n" +
                "Tip 4: Lucio's abilities will not effect teammates who aren't in line of sight of you. If they are behind a wall,\n" +
                "they won't get shield from your ultimate, healing or speed boost from your Crossfade, and it won't do you any good\n" +
